            It is the policy of <strong>@Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => Model.Client.Clinic.Name)</strong> . that all clients transported by 
            <strong>@Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => Model.Client.Clinic.Name)</strong> must wear seatbelts at all times. If you fail to follow this policy, you agree 
            that you do so at your own risk. 
            If an injury occurs as a result of failure to follow this policy, you agree that you will be fully responsible for any 
            injuries sustained as a result of your failure to wear a seatbelt and you release <strong>@Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => Model.Client.Clinic.Name)</strong>

            It is the policy of <strong>@Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => Model.Client.Clinic.Name)</strong> . from time to time, to distribute snacks and 
            prepared foods, including breakfast and lunch, to clients attending the program. I hereby release <strong>@Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => Model.Client.Clinic.Name)</strong> .
            from any liability, in the rare event that a possible ill effect may occur, as 
            the result of our organization’s food distribution. This release of liability also applies to lunches that I may choose 
            to take home to enjoy following the program. 
            We, at <strong>@Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => Model.Client.Clinic.Name)</strong>  strive to provide the best quality of services to our 
            clients, and, as such, have implemented strict controls to closely monitor our food service process in order to 
            prevent ill effects from occurring. 
            I have read and understand all of the conditions stated above. Furthermore, I assert that I am the legal guardian of 
            the above named client and that as such, I have the right to sign on behalf of the client.
