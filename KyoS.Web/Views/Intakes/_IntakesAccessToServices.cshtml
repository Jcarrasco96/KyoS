            In the event of an emergency, recipients will request assistance from a 24-hour staff member, all of whom are 
            trained in evacuation emergency procedures and would help them evacuate the building. 

            The following events would constitute an emergency that would require the recipient to report immediately to a staff        
            member: 

            1. Smelling or seeing smoke or fire
            2. Smelling of gas
            3. Flooding water
            4. Apparent illness of another person or staff member
            5. Unlawful entry of a person onto the facility
            6. Accidents or injuries of another recipient or staff member
            7. Violence or altercations
            8. Finding drugs on premises

            Recipient or staff may call 911 in an emergency. In the event of a fire, all staff is trained during bi-annual fire drills 
            to meet at a pre-designated area (located in the grass area in front of the corporate office building). 

            Recipients who are experiencing an emergency in their home would access immediate services by dialing 911 and 
            then contacting their case manager for support. 

            The above written policy has been explained to me and I understand what I need to do in the event of an emergency.
