    <strong>NO HARM CONTRACT</strong>
   
    I <u><strong>@Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => Model.Client.Name)</strong></u>, agree to not harm myself or others in any way, attempt to kill myself or others during the duration of counseling services.

    I agree that, for any reason, if the appointment session is postponed, canceled, etc., that this time period is extended until the next direct meeting with my counselor.
    In this period, I agree to care for myself, to eat well, and to get enough sleep each night.

    I agree to rid my presence of all things i could use to harm or kill myself and others. I agree that, if I am having a rough time and come to a point where I may break
    any of these promises, I will call and make significant contact with any of the following individuals:

    <strong>Suicide Crisis Hotline at#
    1-800-SUICIDE    (1-800-784-2433)
    1-800-273-TALK  (1-800-273-8255)
    OR  911</strong>

    I agree that these conditions are important, worth doing, and that this is a contract I am willing to make and keep. By my word and honor, I intend to keep this contract.
