                Whenever you wish to lodge a formal complaint you must proceed in the following manner:

                STEP 1: Bring your grievance to the attention of your therapist/therapist supervisor - this may be done verbally or in
                        writing. An answer the agency’s management will be presented to you within 5 days. If your grievance involves 
                        your therapist/psychiatrist and you feel that you do not want to confront him/her directly with this matter, you may 
                        proceed to Step 2. 
                STEP 2 If therapist cannot resolve the problem satisfactorily, you may seek out the clinical director and present your 
                        complaint verbally or in writing. An answer from the supervisor will be presented to you within 5 working days. 
                STEP 3: If you are not satisfied with the decision of the supervisor, you may send the grievance, in writing, to 
                        <strong>@Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => Model.Client.Clinic.Name)</strong>  Program Administrator. 
                        <strong>
                        Phone number: @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => Model.Client.Clinic.Phone)   Fax Number: @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => Model.Client.Clinic.FaxNo)
                        Address: @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => Model.Client.Clinic.Address) @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => Model.Client.Clinic.City) @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => Model.Client.Clinic.State) @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => Model.Client.Clinic.ZipCode) 
                        </strong>
            Your grievance will be reviewed by the Executive Director and he/she may seek a hearing with you and/or the parties Involved. 
            If necessary, the Executive Director will make a decision and will respond to you within thirty (30) days, sending a copy of the 
            response to the supervisor of your targeted case manager. The decision of the Executive Director will be final. 

            It is the sincere desire of the staff of <strong>@Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => Model.Client.Clinic.Name)</strong>  to address your grievances with an 
            attitude of open mindedness and without prejudice. Every effort will be made to resolve your grievance at the lowest 
            possible step in the procedure so as not to prolong any difficulty or problem.
