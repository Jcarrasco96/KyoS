    <strong>Client's Signature Verification Form</strong>  

    This form is to authenticate the signature(s) of client/parent/legal guardian in order to prevent intentional deception, misrepresentation or
    unauthorized services provided by a health care provider, which may constitutes fraud under federal and state laws related to Medicaid. This 
    form may be used regularly to verify the authenticity of signatures on forms and documents and will help to eliminate signature discrepancies.

    Please sign your name in black or blue ink within the box below and try to keep your signature as consistent as possible:

    *By signing below, I <strong>(@Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => Model.TcmClient.Client.Name))</strong> (client/parent/legal guardian) agree that my signature as shown

    any other legal documentation. I understand that any significant change in my signature or in my ability to sign, must be immediately
